You are give  an inputArray of length N and asked to create a program that colors its elements in red, green, and blue in the following way:

- all red elements must be incstrictly increasing order
- all green elements must be in strictly decreasing order
- all remaining elements should be painted blue, but the number of blue elements should be kept to a minimum.
- elements can be painted non-consecutively.

The program should return the minimum possible number of blue elelements in the array.
The initial code has been written bu it doesn't functions as described above.

Take the following into account:
1 <= N <= 45
1 <= inputArray[i] <= 99 (1 <= i <= N)

Example 1
input 1 (N): 12
input 2 (inputArray): 7, 8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 8, 7
output 2

Explanation:
The following elements can be painted red:1, 2, 4, 5, 8
And the following elements cna be painted green: 8, 6, 3, 2, 1
That leaves the following elements to be painted in blue : 7, 7


Example 2
input 1 (N): 8
input 2 (inputArray): 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1
output 0

Explanation:
The following elements can be painted red: 1, 2, 3, 4
And the following elements cna be painted green: 4, 3, 2, 1
That leaves no elements to be painted in blue.
Thus, the answer is 0.
